    <h1>Buffalo National River</h1>

    <p> 
        The Buffalo National River, in Northern Arkansas, was the first National River to be designated 
        in the United States. The Buffalo River is 153 miles (246 km) long. The lower 135 miles (217 km) 
        flow within the boundaries of an area managed by the National Park Service, where the stream is 
        designated the Buffalo National River.[2] The river flows through Newton, Searcy, Marion, and 
        Baxter Counties, from west to east. The river originates in the highest part of the Boston 
        Mountains of the Ozarks, flows out onto the Springfield Plateau near the historic community of 
        Erbie, and finally crosses a portion of the Salem Plateau just before joining the White River. 
        The Park is home to the state's only elk herd. The upper section of the river in the Ozark National
        Forest is managed by the U.S. Forest Service and is designated as a National Scenic River and a
        National Wild River.

    <h2>History of the Buffalo National River</h2>
    <p>
        The Buffalo National River was established by an Act of Congress on March 1, 1972, ending the 
        recurring plans of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to construct one or more dams on the river.[3] 
        The National River designation protects natural rivers from industrial uses, impoundments and 
        other obstructions that may change the natural character of the river or disrupt the natural 
        habitat for the flora and fauna that live in or near the river. Three segments totaling 11,978 
        acres (48.47 km2) were designated the Buffalo National River Wilderness in 1975.[4]

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        At a point about 15 miles (24 km) above the Park boundary in Newton County, Arkansas, the 
        Buffalo River begins as the Main Prong of Big Buffalo Creek. The river flows north through 
        Boxley to Ponca, where it then begins an eastward trek across northern Arkansas to its confluence
        with the White River on the Marion-Baxter County line. Advanced canoeists and kayakers often 
        refer to the 15-mile (24 km) section upriver from Boxley as the Hailstone River. This extremely 
        challenging section of the river is floatable only during periods of high water and should be
        attempted only by those with solid whitewater skills.
